This is my first blog in a while because I have had a bit of a mess up with posting. This is due to me forgetting to post or I have had technical issues. This is all sorted now and from here on in, I will be posting regularly (once a week). 

Last lesson, I was not here due to being ill so I did not get a blog done then. In today's lesson (01/12/16), we were left to do what we wanted out of a choice of two things: fuze boxes and editing our blog pages. I chose the second one because there was quite a few things that needed changing. I changed my background, some fonts and some colours as you can see here.

In the past 3 lessons I have attended, something odd has occurred. Every time I type something in and go on google images, it comes up with just pictures of the gorilla that got shot in a zoo, Harambe. However, this has been fixed (by Mr.Tansley) so that does no longer happen. I think I may have left my computer logged on because that is not something the computer itself would do and somebody else must have done it to my account.

Anyway, from now on I will be posting much more regularly and they will be more informative.

In today's lesson, Guy and I started the second project about variables. We had to enter some code into our computers. This was the code:

CLS

Apples=6

Print "We have “; Apples; ," Apples”

Print

Wait(1)

Print "If we eat one…"

Print 

Apples = Apples - 1

Wait(2)

Print "then we have “;Apples;" left.”

I learnt lots of things in this lesson and I thoroughly enjoyed it!

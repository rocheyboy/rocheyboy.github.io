What we did today

The first thing we did in our IT lesson, like always, was log on to our computers. Then we got out our previous homework (computer components blog) and went through the answers. Then we watched a video about presenting with a website called Prezi. After watching that, we made our own Prezi accounts which was, handily, very easy to do. We then saw some of Mr Keen's Prezis which were very clever and interesting. Finally, we made our own Prezis and finished them for homework. It was a very cool lesson!

What we did today 2

In today's lesson, we did about media literacy. We were given a bingo document with questions on and we had to find people who said yes as their answer to them. If somebody said yes, then we could not ask them any more questions. We had to get a five in a row out of 25 boxes that were there. I didn’t manage to get five in a row, but I did get 11 boxes. The hardest question was probably 'Do you have twitter?’ because not many people in year 7 have twitter. The easiest question was probably ‘Do you have access to the internet almost whenever you want?’ because the majority of people in our area have wifi in their houses.

I completed all the work that was set in the lesson.

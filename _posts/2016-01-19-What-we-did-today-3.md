**What we did today**

In today's IT lesson, we came in as usual and logged onto our computers. Then we talked about our homeworks that we had done since last week. Jake Barry came up to the front and talked about his homework. He had done it on a Christmas advert by Aldi. It was good.

We then watched a Pepsi advert where an Englishman got into a taxi in a foreign country and asked to get to the airport as quick as possible. The taxi driver was sitting in the passenger seat as he threw back a can of Pepsi. He then proceeded to hold up a picture of a plane to a chimpanzee who was driving. The chimp then drove on the wrong side of the road towards the airport. The Englishman said "Are you sure?" to which the man in the passenger seat said “Don't worry, it has no sugar!”	

We talked about how that advert was fantastical because of many drink a drink that has just been handed to you in a taxi in a foreign country by a man who trusts a chimp to drive? Would you sit there without your seatbelt on? Is it possible for a chimp to drive a car on the wrong side of the road extremely fast and not crash into anyone? All these are good ideas and I could be here all day listing them all.

We then watched an advert about McDonald's and it started off with the director of marketing for McDonald's in Canada (Hope Bagozzi) showing a question asked by someone which was 'Why does your food look different in the advertising than what is in the store?’ Hope then went into a local McDonald’s and asked for a ‘Quarter-pounder with cheese’ which she was given. It looked flat and not the same as the one in the adverts. 	

She went to the photo studio after that where she met Noah (the food stylist) and Neil (the photographer). Neil took a picture of the fresh burger that Hope had just bought from the shop. Hope said that the burger from McDonald's takes about 1 or 2 minutes to make whereas the one for the adverts takes several hours.	

She said that all of the ingredients used in the advert are the same in the shop just more time is put into making it. Noah carefully syringed the ketchup and mustard onto the burger, so it made it look delicious. Neil then took a picture of the finished piece.	

Hope then met up with Stuart (the imagery specialist) who edited the burger on the computer. If there were holes in the bun, then he'd smoothen them over. If there were jagged edges on the cheese, he would fix them. Then Stuart put the two pictures together and you could see a big difference in the burgers.	

We then got up and one side of the room was called 'agree' and the other was called ‘disagree’. Mr Keen said statements and we had to agree or disagree with them. One of them was ‘I think you should be able to download music from the internet for free.’

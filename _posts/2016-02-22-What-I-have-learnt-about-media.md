In the past few weeks of IT lessons, we have been learning about media which you can read about in my last 4 blogs. We have learnt that there are many different types of media such as books/magazines/newspapers, social media, television, video games etc.

We learnt that social media is a very dangerous place because even if you are private on something, anything you say can get passed on to friends of friends and so on. If you posted something that you only wanted your friends to see, then it could become viral. Twitter is a very good example of this because although you can be private, people can retweet anything you say onto their account showing their followers and before you know it, the whole world could be laughing at you. There was a woman called Justine Sacco who was racist on twitter and soon became a world phenomenon. She had tweeted "Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. Iâ€™m white!" She did not mean to be racist, or send it to everyone in the world, but she accidently did it and as soon as she got off the plane and checked twitter and realised she was famous, for that racist tweet. 

Another interesting fact that we learnt was SnapChat was originally made for sexting which is sending almost naked/naked photos to one another. This is bad because you might not be able to trust the person you are sending it to and it could be spread around. Also, if you really love the person, then you should just show it in real life because then they have no proof that you have done it.

What we did today

In today's lesson, we looked at who had handed in and who had not handed in homework. There were three things to do: plan our own microbit game, leave a link to our latest blog and show all our coding from microbit in one google document. Some peopleâ€™s names popped up on more than two occasions in the not done section, but all of mine were in the done section.

Mr Keen told us that we should never leave our homework until the last minute and also talk to him if we had problems with our homework or if we were finding it difficult. 

We had to put all of our blog posts into one folder in google drive next. When we had done that, I started to make my game that I had planned previously for homework whilst some other people handed things in. I am proud of it so far.

Overall, I enjoyed the lesson!

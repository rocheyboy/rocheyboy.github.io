What we did today

In today's IT lesson, we did a variety of enjoyable and educational activities. The first thing we did was log on to our computers as usual. Next, we talked about our homework and how we had managed to convert the PDF that Mr Keen had sent us a link to into Dochub so we could edit it and then back into a PDF. We then talked to our partners and decided on a target for our homework which we proceeded to write in our planners.	

Next, Mr Keen split the whiteboard into two sections. One side said 'advantages' and the other said ‘disadvantages’. We all had to write a disadvantage or an advantage of social media. I wrote and advantage which was, ‘We can talk to our friends when we are not able to meet up with them.’ After everyone had written one, we went through them. Some people put pointless things, whereas some were very useful!

Next, we got into groups of 5 and were given sheets about things that could occur. They ranged from 'You tell someone that you are going to a party and you tell them where it is and when it is' to ‘You post the quote of the day.’ We had to put them in order of how dangerous they could be if they were posted to the whole world.

We finally talked about the dangers of social media and how if you post something only meant for one person, it could spread and go to bullies which gives them an excuse to bully you. We talked about how we shouldn't post anything we wouldn’t want our parents to see or anything that we wouldn’t say to someone’s face.

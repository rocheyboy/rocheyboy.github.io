In today's IT lesson, we learnt some very interesting things about the Fuze box. At the start of our lesson, we got into our pairs and set up our Fuze boxes. I was with Guy Lane. First, we had to plug in the power cable into the socket, plug in the mouse and then connect it to the monitor. Then we had to load up the Fuze box onto our screens. We used the book to help us work through the tasks which were very enjoyable!

I learnt lots of new things about programming and I thoroughly enjoyed this week's lesson!

**What we did today**

The first thing we did in today's IT lesson was log on to our computers like any other normal lesson. After we had signed in, we looked at our homework and some people volunteered to read out what they had written for their homework. Our homework was on social media and we had to interview a friend or family member who had any accounts on social media. I had interviewed my cousin, Grace and she had said some things about her life on social media. This took up a fair amount of time.   

Next, we looked at some examples of identity maps. These were done by students in Dr Challoner's. An identity map is a piece of A3 paper with things about your identity, such as your age, your roots, your religion and things you enjoy to do/hobbies. We were then told a few more things that we could include. Afterwards, we we given A3 sheets and we had to create our own. It was then the end of the lesson so it was set for our homework.

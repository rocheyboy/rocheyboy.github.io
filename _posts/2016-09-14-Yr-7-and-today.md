In year 7, I did a lot of different topics in IT with Mr Keen. These included making our own websites for our blogs, media literacy, advertisements, social media, our identity, computer components, programming, microbit and propaganda. These were all very enjoyable but my favourite lesson last year was when we played bingo about media.

	Every week last year, we wrote a blog about what we did in the lesson and what we learnt. However, a lot of people did not do one every week, including me. All of our lesson were very interesting though!

In some lessons, I found it hard to concentrate and I need to work on my levels of concentration in lessons and how much I focus when learning something new so that i can take it all in and remember it.

In our first IT lesson of year 8, with Mr Tansley, we set up our Fuze boxes. I was with Guy Lane and my partner. We learnt how to connect it to the monitor and we started our first project of the year. It was very interesting and I learnt lots of new things. We needed a cable, a Fuze box and a power supply. I enjoyed the lesson!

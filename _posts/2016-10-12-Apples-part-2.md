In the lesson today, me and Guy were continuing on our variables project about apples. Again, we had to set up our fuze boxes and enter some code into our computers. Today we added to last weeks work. This was the original code:

CLS

Apples=6

Print "We have “; Apples; ," Apples”

Print

Wait(1)

Print "If we eat one…"

Print 

Apples = Apples - 1

Wait(2)

Print "then we have “;Apples;" left”

END

This is what we added to make it better:

CLS

Apples=6

Print "We have “; Apples; ," Apples”

Print

Wait(1)

Print "If we eat one…"

Print 

Apples = Apples - 1

Wait(2)

Print "then we have “;Apples;" left”

Wait(2)

Repeat until Apples = 0

CLS

Ink=Red

Print "We ran out of Apples!"

Print

Ink=White

END

Once again, I thoroughly enjoyed the lesson and I learnt some fascinating things!

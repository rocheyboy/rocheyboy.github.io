In today's lesson, we came into the classroom, sat down, and logged onto our computers. Then, Mr Keen told us to come and sit at the front, so we did. We proceeded to watch a video from the film *Harry Potter and the Philosopherâ€™s Stone* where people are sorted into their houses from the sorting hat. We then went back to our computers and clicked the link in google classroom which brought us to a place where it told us how to program a sorting hat. That was very easy though, so we went to another place which was harder and we had to write things ourselves. Mr Keen showed us how to and it was set to do for homework. Here is mine:

function onStart(  ) {

	

}

function onPressA(  ) {

	if (1 == Random.number(1, 6)) {

		

		microbit.say("Rayner");

		

	}

	

	if (2 == Random.number(1, 6)) {

		

		microbit.say("Pearson");

		

	}

	

	if (3 == Random.number(1, 6)) {

		

		microbit.say("Thorne");

		

	}

	

	if (4 == Random.number(1, 6)) {

		

		microbit.say("Foxell");

		

	}

	

	if (5 == Random.number(1, 6)) {

		

		microbit.say("Holman");

		

	}

	

	if (6 == Random.number(1, 6)) {

		

		microbit.say("Newman");

Overall, it was a great lesson and i thoroughly enjoyed it!

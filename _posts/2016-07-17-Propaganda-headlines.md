1.	                                         		

This headline says 'MUSLIM KILLERS' in big, **bold** writing. It is propaganda because it is misleading people to think that all Muslims are bad, even though only a small fraction of Muslims are actually bad. The *New York Post  *could have said ‘PERSON IS KILLED’, but they want people to hate all Muslims.

2. 

	This headline says 'Obama Has a Big Problem With White Women'. This misleads the readers to think that Barack Obama is racist because he does not like women. This newspaper clearly doesn’t like Obama and they want other people to not like him either. They would know that lots of white women would read it, and that’s who they are aiming it at.

3.   

                                                      	This headline says that the Queen is backing Brexit. However, she would never say something like that to the public. *The Sun* is trying to get people to like Brexit as this was probably before the vote happened. They were probably fans of Brexit and followed them and wanted people to do the same so that they won the vote.

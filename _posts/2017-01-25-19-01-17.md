    <td> I read all the instructions on the left side of the screen and I made sure to take it all in. I also worked everything out by myself and not asking somebody else. Sometimes I would challenge myself in the exercise too.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td> I did get stuck on the exercises a few times and had to re-read the instructions because I made small errors like forgetting capital letters but I managed to figure it all out in the end.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will try and read the instructions even more carefully so that I can get it right every time because that would make it a whole lot easier.</td>

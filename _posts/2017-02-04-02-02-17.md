  <tr>
    <td>I used the same skills as before to complete the tasks, but it took me longer as they were harder and more challenging exercises. I made sure to read everything.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I had to ask a friend in some instances and they pointed out what the problem was and it would tend to be quite obvious which made me look stupid. However, they didn't just tell me the answers, they only gave me clues and hints.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will make sure I read everything TWICE before asking a friend as that is just an easy way out of the situation.</td>

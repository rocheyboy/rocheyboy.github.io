What we did today

The first thing that we did in today's IT lesson was log on to our computers like usual. We then went through our homework and Mr Keen read through some peopleâ€™s. A lot of people had grammar mistakes. Fortunately, mine had no mistakes, but it was not read out.

After this, we wrote about 10 positive things on social media in groups of three or four. We then watched a video about a girl who didn't have a phone and everything she did and everywhere she went, people were on their phones. There were examples like she was at a coffee shop with her friends, and everyone was talking and then they all just went on their phones.

We finally watched another video which was a song about twitter. They were singing about how twitter is very useful for posting pictures of your feet and food and silly things like that. One girl was saying that it was useless, until a boy told her that it can do other things. He said that it helped spread the Arab Spring which was big. We talked about that video for the rest of the lesson.

In today's lesson (8/12/16), I learnt how to change my container, text and make a textbox with colour. I found this very interesting and I managed to change my blog pageâ€™s appearance. The first thing I did was change the container. This means that you can make the text narrower or wider. I made it wider, but only slightly so that it looks perfect.

The next thing I learnt was actually a recap of simple stuff from last year. I learnt how to change my text colour and font. The font that this text you are reading now has changed and so has the colour. The same happened with the title^^^. 

Finally, the hardest part of the lesson was how I learnt to make a textbox. I was struggling at first, but Mr Tansley came and helped me and after he told me what to do, I managed to complete the task. If you are wondering what I am talking about, look around and you can see some faded black box. That is the textbox. While I was at it, I changed the background too. You can see that as well on your screen.

All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the lesson and I am looking forward to next week so that I can make some more changes to my blog!

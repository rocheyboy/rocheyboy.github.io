What we did today

In our IT lesson today, we checked to see if our website was working smoothly. If there were any problems, then we would have to figure out how to solve them. I had a problem with the colour of my text so I sorted that out by going to HTML colour picker and choosing a colour, then copying the hashtag and pasting it into my coding. Then we went onto 'CSS font stack' and we chose a font which we also copied and pasted into our coding. We also changed the colour of our background by doing the same process as we did for changing the text colour. When we had finished all that, we checked all our coding to make sure it was correct and we added a few finishing touches to it.
